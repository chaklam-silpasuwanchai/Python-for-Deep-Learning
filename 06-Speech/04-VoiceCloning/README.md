Text-to-Speech (TTS): A system that converts normal language text on a computer into audible speech output.

Multi-Speaker TTS: Synthesizing speech with different voices with a single model.

Transfer learning (TL): It is a research problem in machine learning (ML) that focuses on storing knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem
