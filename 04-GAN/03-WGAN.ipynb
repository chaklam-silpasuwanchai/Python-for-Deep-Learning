    "\n",
    "When you are training multiple classes, there are multiple modes (multimodals) which the generator needs to be learned such as \"1\", \"2\", \"3\", and so on. If the generator has a task to create many classes from dataset, some classes are easier to generate. That will fool the discriminator easily. For example, in MNIST, number 1 can fool the discriminator, but number 3 cannot fool it. When the generator generates number 3, the discriminator will attack to the generator that it is fake but when the generator create number 1, the discriminator mostly say it is real. Thus, the generator will learn that \"OK, if I create '1', I will get reward\", then it will generate only number 1. That's is bias dataset creation called **Mode collapse**.\n",
    "\n",
    "During this whole training process, the discriminator naturally is trying to delineate this real and fake distribution as much as possible, whereas the generator is trying to make the generated distribution look more like the reals.\n",
    "However, let's take a step back again to the generator and discriminators roles. \n",
    "The discriminator needs to output just a single value prediction within zero and one.\n",
    "Whereas the generator actually needs to produce a pretty complex output composed of multiple features to try and fool the discriminator, for example, an image.\n",
    "As a result that discriminators job tends to be a little bit easier. That's why GANs may go to mode collapse. That is because the discriminator learns faster than the generator. Finally, the cost function from discriminato will go to nearly \"one\" then it will not tell anything to generator, it is called **vanishing gradients** problem."

    "1.   Even on GPU, the **training will run more slowly** because the gradient penalty requires you to compute the gradient of a gradient -- this means potentially a few minutes per epoch! For best results, run this for as long as you can while on GPU.\n",
    "2.   One important difference from earlier versions is that you will **update the critic multiple times** every time you update the generator This helps prevent the generator from overpowering the critic. Sometimes, you might see the reverse, with the generator updated more times than the critic. This depends on architectural (e.g. the depth and width of the network) and algorithmic choices (e.g. which loss you're using). \n",
    "3.   WGAN-GP isn't necessarily meant to improve overall performance of a GAN, but just **increases stability** and avoids mode collapse. In general, a WGAN will be able to train in a much more stable way than the vanilla DCGAN from last assignment, though it will generally run a bit slower. You should also be able to train your model for more epochs without it collapsing.\n",

    "If you have time, train for 25,000 steps. Good luck!\n"
