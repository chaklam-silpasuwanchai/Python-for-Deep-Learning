## Introduction

This repository is a comprehensive collection of recent trends in deep learning. It is organized into several key topics to help you navigate the rapidly evolving field. The repository extends from the foundational work available at [dsai-asia/RTML](https://github.com/dsai-asia/RTML).

## Topics

### Classic

This section covers fundamental concepts and algorithms that have stood the test of time in the field of deep learning. It includes seminal papers, foundational models, and essential techniques.

### Object Detection

In this section, we focus on recent advancements in object detection. You will find state-of-the-art models, innovative approaches, and applications that push the boundaries of what is possible in detecting and classifying objects within images and videos.

### Segmentation

Segmentation techniques aim to partition an image into meaningful regions. This section includes the latest research on semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and other related areas.

### GAN

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have revolutionized the field of generative modeling. This section covers cutting-edge GAN architectures, training techniques, and applications in various domains.

### Diffusion

Diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for generating high-quality data samples. This section explores the latest developments in diffusion models, their theoretical foundations, and practical implementations.

### Speech

Speech recognition and synthesis are critical areas of deep learning research. This section includes recent papers, models, and tools related to automatic speech recognition (ASR), text-to-speech (TTS), and other speech processing tasks.
